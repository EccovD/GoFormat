# GoFormat

- Create folder
- Download the code
- [Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Add excel sheet to folder and rename file to input.xlsx (Make sure that you have opened/edited the source file)
- Open command prompt, navigate to the folder you created above, and run the code below!
```
go run main.go
```

After initial run, you will just need to follow steps 6 and 7. Filename must be input.xlsx so overwrite the last file when you need a new run.
